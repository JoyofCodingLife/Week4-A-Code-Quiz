## General Info
The task of this assignment was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app has to run in the browser and to feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code, and all created from scratch.

I made the design very minimalistic. The same it tried to achieve in HTML, CSS and JS codes - to make them clean and easy to follow.

The most challenging part for me was make functions to save and store data.
